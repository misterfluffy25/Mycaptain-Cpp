Problem - 

Write a C++ Program to Find Size of int, float, double and char in Your System Your output should look something like this Size of char: 1 byte Size of int: 4 bytes Size of float: 4 bytes Size of double: 8 bytes

Solution - 

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() 
{    
    cout << "Size of char: " << sizeof(char) << " byte" << endl;
    cout << "Size of int: " << sizeof(int) << " bytes" << endl;
    cout << "Size of float: " << sizeof(float) << " bytes" << endl;
    cout << "Size of double: " << sizeof(double) << " bytes" << endl;

    return 0;
}

Output - 

Size of char: 1 byte
Size of int: 4 bytes
Size of float: 4 bytes
Size of double: 8 bytes
