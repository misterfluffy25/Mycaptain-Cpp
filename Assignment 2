Problem -

Write a C++ program where we check if a person is eligible to vote or not. We ask the user for an input of their age and give them an output which states whether or not they are eligible.

SOlution - 

#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main(){
    int age, adnumber;
    string name;
    cout<<"Enter the name of the Candidate: "<<endl;
        cin>>name;
    cout<<"Enter your Age: "<<endl;
       cin>>age;
        if(age>17){
            cout<<"Eligible to vote"<<endl;
            cout<<"Choose your Representative wisely"<<endl;
                } 
        else{
            cout<<"Not Eligible to Vote"<<endl;
            cout<<"Wait for: "<<18 - age<<" Years to Vote. Thanks !"<<endl;
            }
     return 0;
}

Output - 

1. If true - 

Enter the name of the Candidate: 
yash
Enter your Age:
18
Eligible to vote
Choose your Representative wisely

2. If false - 

Enter the name of the Candidate: 
hello
Enter your Age: 
12
Not Eligible to Vote
Wait for: 6Years to Vote. Thanks !
